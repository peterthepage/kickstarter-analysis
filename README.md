Performing analysis on kickstarter data to uncover trends
#Overview of Analysis From the Kickstarter Data
The purpose of this analysis was to find out how to structure a kickstarter campaign to increase the odds of it succeeding. We wanted to find as many campaigns that were as close to
our planned campaign to find out how and when to start the campaign.
#Analysis
The best way to go about getting a successful campaign done is a May or June start date with a goal lower than 10000. Those months were the most successful and there is a much
higher chance to hit the goal if it is below 10000. There is even a higher chance if it is kept to under 5000.
#Issues
I had a tough time with getting the average to work when putting in the extra code to return values if we were dividing by 0.
#Two Conclusions
The first conclusion is that a May or June start date is the best time to start a campaign. Secondly, summer is when more campaigns are launched.
#Outcomes
The lower your goal the higher possibility of the campaign succeeding.
#Limitations
A lack of data for higher goals. The money is all in each country's currency, therefore there is no way to truly understand how much each value for goal and pledged.
#Possible Options
We could create a table comparing the difference in success rate depending on the length of the campaign.
